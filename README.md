# CARMA

## Some Tasks to Work on:

	1. ICA on K2 AGN LCs to classify and resolve systematics

		a. Try running ICA on all objects
		b. Associate ICA component weights with positions on the CCD, (RA/DEC, module, channel, etc)
		c. Use KDE to build a kernel that can be selected from based on position parameters
		d. Use KDE result to coeect light curves based on position

	2. Effects of sampling on CARMA parameters

	3. Comparison of various processing of LCs from raw data, including our own
